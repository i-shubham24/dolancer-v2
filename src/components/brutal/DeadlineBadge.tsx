 * One escalation rule, used everywhere: neutral above 48h, warning 12 to 48h,
 * critical under 12h. Urgency is never colour alone, so the text always carries it
 * too, and overdue reads as elapsed time rather than a negative countdown.
 *
 * Cards get the relative form; detail views get the absolute time with a timezone,
 * because deadlines are stored in UTC and a doer may be in a different country from
 * whoever set it.
