  {
    question: "When do I get paid?",

      "After your supervisor has cleared the delivery and the client approval gate is satisfied. If a client does not respond, the approved timeout process may release the payout later. Your earnings page itemises every payout with its own receipt.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a project pay?",
    answer:
      "Each assigned offer states the doer payout before you accept it. There is no public rate card because the payout reflects the specific scope, deadline and level rules for that project.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the money reach me?",
    answer:
      "Payouts go to your registered payout account over UPI or NEFT once the approval gate clears. Each one lands with an itemised receipt you can check against your own records.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do projects reach me?",
    answer:
      "A supervisor manually routes specific projects to vetted doers whose verified disciplines fit the brief. There is no public work pool, bidding, proposal process or client search.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I work on several projects at once?",
    answer:
      "The platform limits active projects so that delivery quality stays manageable. The current limit is shown in your dashboard and may prevent new offers while your slots are full.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I talk to the client?",
    answer:
      "No. You work with a supervisor, who is your point of contact. The client sees only a discipline label and does not receive your name or personal details.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do you need to verify me?",
    answer:
      "Verification may require a PAN, a government photo identity document and payout details. The exact fields and retention rules are explained in the Privacy Policy before submission.",
  },
  {
    question: "What work is not allowed?",
    answer:
      "Dolancer does not accept coursework, essays, dissertations, exams, graded assignments, impersonation, plagiarism, fabrication, unauthorised cyber security work or other unlawful requests. Ask support if a brief is unclear.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my work needs changes?",
    answer:
      "Your supervisor explains what needs changing and you revise within the accepted brief. Work outside the original scope must be raised with the supervisor before you continue.",
