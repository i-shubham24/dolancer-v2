/**
 * Start every navigation at the top, instantly.
 *
 * A single-page app keeps the scroll position across route changes, so following a
 * link from halfway down one page drops you halfway down the next one, which reads
 * as a broken page rather than a new one.
 *
 * The jump is instant, never smooth: animating to the top reads as another
 * loading state and fights pinned scroll sections. ScrollTrigger positions are
 * refreshed after the jump so pinned and scrubbed sections measure correctly.
 *
 * Two exceptions are deliberate. An in-page hash is left alone, since the browser is
 * already handling it and overriding would break every anchor link. And a POP, which
 * is the back and forward buttons, keeps its position: returning to where you were
 * is the whole point of going back.
